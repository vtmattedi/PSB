### If running while this inside a folder, adjust the path i.e:
```q1.asm -> 'Lista06/q1.asm' (for all files)``` or ```cd 'Lista06'```

## Replit sucks now:
Basically, I can not use replit anymore since they made their hours cutdown on the free tier, even for leaving a tab open. So im no longer using replit. I am simply using WSL and vscode. (Which is way better) so I will no longer use ;# since just the ; highlights as a comment on my enviroment.

### Question 1:
```nasm -f elf64 q1.asm && gcc -o q1 q1.o -no-pie -z execstack -lm && ./q1```

### Question 2:
```nasm -f elf64 q2.asm && gcc -o q2 q2.o -no-pie -z execstack -lm && ./q2```
